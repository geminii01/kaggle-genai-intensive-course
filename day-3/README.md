# Day 3

## 🎒 Today's Assignment

### Complete Unit 3a - "Generative AI Agents":

- Listen to the *summary podcast episode* for this unit.

- To complement the podcast, read the "*[Generative AI Agents](./22365_19_Agents_v8.pdf)*" whitepaper. 

- Complete these codelabs on Kaggle:

    - *[Talk](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hongjaemin/day-3-function-calling-with-the-gemini-api)* to a database with function calling.
    
    - *[Build](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hongjaemin/day-3-building-an-agent-with-langgraph)* an agentic ordering system in LangGraph.

### [Optional] Advanced 3b - "Agents Companion":

- Listen to the *summary podcast episode* for this unit.

- Read the advanced "*[Agents Companion](./Agents_Companion_v2%20(3).pdf)*" whitepaper.

- Want to have an *interactive conversation* ? Try adding the whitepaper to *NotebookLM* .

## 💡 What You'll Learn

Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. You'll also learn more about advanced agentic architectures and approaches such as multi-agent systems, agent evaluation and more.

The codelabs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot (including an example using Gemini 2.0's *[Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live?hl=ko)*), and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a café.
