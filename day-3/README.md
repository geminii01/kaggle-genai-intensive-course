## ðŸ’¡ What You'll Learn

Learn to build sophisticated AI agents by understanding their core components and the iterative development process. You'll also learn more about advanced agentic architectures and approaches such as multi-agent systems, agent evaluation and more.

The codelabs cover how to connect LLMs to existing systems and to the real world. Learn about function calling by giving SQL tools to a chatbot (including an example using Gemini 2.0's *[Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live?hl=ko)*), and learn how to build a LangGraph agent that takes orders in a cafÃ©.
